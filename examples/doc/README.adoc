= Documenting a assembler program

We show how to document an assemble program.

You can experiment it calling:
----
./make.sh test
----

This command add debug instructions in the .asm file. 
You can see the intermediate file `demo_if.debug.asm` in the `work/debug` folder.

This file is compiled and it's used during the test. 
When executing, it outputs register values and instruction executed.

The test gets the output and show the result after some transformation to keep only important lines or information.

The assembler code to include in the documentation is retrieve using asciidoc include directives with tags.

All `.adoc` generated are moved in the `docs`folder after the execution.
