= Makefile usage

You can try the Makefile you want with the option `-f`.

----
make -f Makefile_A run
----


The makefile just include a shared Makefile. 
By default, program name and test name are the name of the folder.

You can change it with the variable `PROGRAM_NAME`.
So, you could have several programs in a same folder. 

The main file should be: [PROGRAM_NAME].main.c +
And the test file should be: [PROGRAM_NAME].test.c

You can have several main files and test files in the same folder.
