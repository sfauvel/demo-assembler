= NASM with Docker

`Dockerfile` in the folder `docker` provides a container (based on `alpine`) to build and run assembler with `asm` and c with `gcc`.

You can build it going to `docker` folder and run command:
`docker build --tag demo_nasm:1.0 .`

To run this container, go to the root path of the project `demo_asm` and use: 
`docker run -it -v $(pwd):/usr/app -w /usr/app -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" demo_nasm:1.0`

You will be in a bash shell where you can execute all demos of the project.

For example, you can run: 
`. quick_start_autorun/run.sh`

== Explain

Docker command line explanation:
----
docker run -it \             # Run docker in interaction mode 
    -v $(pwd):/usr/app \     # Make current folder available as /usr/app in container
    -w /usr/app \            # Start container in /usr/app folder
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \ # Run container with current user
    demo_nasm:1.0            # Run this image
----

We run container with current user to be able to remove temporary folder created inside container (`target`).
